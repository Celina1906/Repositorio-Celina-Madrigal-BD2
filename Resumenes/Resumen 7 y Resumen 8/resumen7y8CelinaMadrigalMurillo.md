# 5 Use Cases for Graph Technology

## When your data is complex, the solution is in the graph. 

Most companies have a data problem. The more complicated 
the problem, the more likely a graph data platform can solve 
it.

### Here are five of the top use cases for graph technology.

**1. Fraud Detection:** Banks and insurance companies lose billions every year to fraud. Many companies are swapping time-consuming traditional methods with AI and machine learning.

**2. Real-Time Recommendations:** To be relevant and prevent a potential customer from clicking to a competitor, recommendations must be contextual and instantaneous

**3. Bill of Materials:** For vehicles, durable goods, and more, tracking every component and its cost, what equipment the components relate to, and the expected product lifespan/average time to failure into a mass bill of materials (BoM) is a behemoth operation for an organization like the United States Army, which deploys a staggering amount of equipment.

**4. Track & Trace:** Graph data models enable traceability for a variety of industries and use cases, including routing, logistics, supply chain management, and compliance. Track and trace enables us to find out the status of a product (batch, mail/ parcel, train, ship, container, etc.) wherever it is in the supply chain and to identify and verify its path.

**5. Network & IT Ops:** Graph databases are a natural fit for network and IT ops; after all, a network is a graph. The graph’s connected structure enables network managers to conduct sophisticated impact analyses.


# A Brief Introduction to Graph Data Platforms 

## What Are Graph Databases Good for?

Graph database technology is specifically designed and optimized for highly interconnected datasets to identify patterns and hidden connections.

The most common graph use cases and solutions include:

**• Fraud Detection & Analytics:** Real-time analysis of data relationships is essential to uncovering fraud rings and other sophisticated scams. 

**• Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:** Artificial intelligence (AI) winners and losers will be decided based on who harnesses context within data for a true competitive advantage. 

**• Real-Time Recommendation Engines:** Graph-powered recommendation engines help companies personalize products, content and services by building a contextualized map of offers using both historical and real-time data. 

**• Knowledge Graphs:** Graph-based search tools tap into your organization’s institutional memory.

**• Network & Database Infrastructure Monitoring:** Graph databases are inherently more suitable than RDBMS for making sense of complex interdependencies central to managing   networks, data centers, cybersecurity and IT infrastructure. 

**• Master Data Management (MDM):** The schema-optional graph database model allows you to organize and manage your master data with flexibility.

Viewed through a technological lens, graph databases tackle the most harrowing of data problems – ones that often linger at the root of project failures and delays. These include: 

• Vastly different views of the data model between business and technology teams, which result in misunderstanding and miscommunication.

• Lack of schema flexibility and adaptability, making it hard to respond to changing business requirements both during a project and after a system has gone live.

• The “JOIN problem” which occurs when queries become so tangled that even powerful databases with massive amounts of hardware resources grind to a halt in their attempts to bring the resulting data together

## Traditional Technology Choices Do Not Consider How Data Is Interrelated

Traditional RDBMS technology has a difficult time expressing and revealing how real and virtual entities are related. Columns and rows aren’t how data exists in the real world. 
Rather, data exists as rich objects and the relationships between those different objects.

## Collections vs. Connections

### SQL & NoSQL Systems Focus on Data Aggregation & Collection

Collection-centric storage designs as implemented by SQL and Not only SQL (NoSQL) databases are designed to efficiently divide and store data.

In SQL’s case, the normalization of data into a tabular schema aims to minimize storage of duplicate data objects, types and values.

The original relational databases were designed to minimize storage of duplicative data values because disk space was costly. The RDBMS design achieved this consolidated, normalized goal by linking tables of data via foreign keys to their associated records from other tables.

NoSQL systems like document, wide column and key-value data stores carry those concepts forward (and backward) by simplifying their models in exchange for higher levels of scale and simplicity. By eschewing data relationships and providing simple programmatic APIs, NoSQL systems make it easy for developers and administrators to work with simple data in a way that can easily scale. 

### Graph Systems Focus on Data Connections

By contrast, graph database technologies focus on how data elements are interrelated and contextualized as connected data. 

Connected data is the materialization and harnessing of relationships between data elements, which is modeled as a property graph. 

A property graph is a data model designed to express data connectedness as nodes connected via relationships to other nodes, where both nodes and relationships can have properties attached to them.

In the graph model, data relationships are persisted so they can be navigated or traversed along connected paths to gain context. Relationships are both typed and directional. 

The context provided by these data connections is essential to identifying friendships, making relevant real-time recommendations, attaching adjacent ideas and detecting fraud by following money trails. Without relationships as first-class data entities, all of these use cases become extremely difficult to execute.

## Property Graphs Are Intentionally Simple

• You can draw property graphs on whiteboards and map that design directly into a graph database. 

• You can change or update a property graph easily, because its agile design eliminates most of the structural overhead of traditional database schemas.

• You can quickly program property graphs because their query language expresses and follows relationships. 

• You can visualize and navigate property graphs efficiently by following the relationships on their paths to context. 

• You can rapidly determine data context when property graph queries are executed in hyper-fast native graph platforms built on reliable, scalable database architectures. 

## Benefits of Graph Databases

**• Simple and natural data modeling:** Graph databases provide flexibility for data modeling, depending on relationship types. 

**• Flexibility for evolving data structures:** Graph technology provides flexible schema evolution.

**• Simultaneous support for real-time updates and queries:** A graph data store and its model allow real-time updates on graph data while supporting queries concurrently.

**• Better, faster and more powerful querying and analytics:** Graph data stores provide superior query performance with connected data using native storage and native indexed data structure.

# The Return on Connected Data

## More Connections, More Value

### Connections Unlock the Value of Data

The value of data comes from an organization’s ability to understand it in relation to other data. By itself, data offers finite value. When connected, data’s value is infinite. 

Increasing data’s connectedness further increases its value through additional context. This is another demonstration of Metcalf’s Law of the Network: network value increases exponentially as you add users or nodes to the network.  

Enticed by the promise of valuable business insights, companies have invested in big data technologies. But dumping data in a data lake doesn’t preserve nor reveal the relationships between data points. And JOIN tables only materialize a relationship when the query is run; relationship information is not a first-class entity in relational nor other types of databases.

Because relational databases don’t persist relationship information in storage or any other stage of their analytic exercises, finding connections requires an enormous amount of extra processing. And persisting these connections over their lifetime is next to impossible.

#### WHAT IS CONNECTED DATA?

Connected data is the representation, usage and persistence of relationships between data elements.

#### CONNECTED DATA ENABLES ORGANIZATIONS TO:

• Gain a 360-degree view of a customer   
• Build a complete network topology  
• Deliver relevant recommendations in real-time  
• Obtain the visibility required to prevent fraud  
• Introduce data science and AI workflows to applications

### Data, Data Everywhere, Nor any Drop to Drink

Organizations are surrounded by data but they’re limited in 
their ability to do anything with it.

Data doesn’t become connected by simply dumping it into a central data lake. Data becomes connected when you treat relationship information as a first-class entity — persisting it, assigning properties to it, and using it as a means to develop context for applications. Thus, it’s best to think of big data needing to be connected, not merely contained.

### The Power of Connected Data

The biggest benefit of connected data is the ability to provide a connected view of the data to your analytic and operational applications, thereby gaining and growing intelligence downstream. The connections can be made available or revealed to applications or business users to make operational decisions. 

Connected data applies to a variety of contexts. In addition to refining the output of your recommendation engines, you can better understand the flow of money to detect fraud and money laundering, and assess the risk of a network outage across computer networks. Connected data also helps you see when and how relationships change over time.

Connected data is most powerful when it provides operational, real-time insights and not just after-the-fact analytics. Real-time insights allow business users and applications to make business decisions and act in real-time. Thus, recommendation engines leverage data from the current user session to deliver highly relevant options that the customer wants or needs at that moment.

IT organizations can proactively mitigate network issues that would otherwise cause an outage, and the antifraud team can put an end to potentially malicious activity before it results in a substantial loss.

### Quench Your Thirst for Insights with Connected Data

A graph database makes it easy to express and persist relationships across many types of data elements. A graph database is a highly scalable transactional and analytic database that stores data relationships as first-class entities. 

Graph databases are simple and agile due to their schema-optional nature. Because the structural overhead of traditional database schema is eliminated, graphs can be easily changed or updated.

You can also get more value out of your big data technology by using graphs to transfer knowledge of what the organization has done across other departments. Graphs keep relationship information always at hand, but that information changes over time. The graph can therefore become a longstanding system of record that delivers value to different departments.

By connecting data, graphs also enable you to leverage all of the data you’ve dumped into your data lake.

Identifying connections in your data is only helpful if you know what to do with them. Graphs can help you with that, too. Today’s applications, whether they be recommendation engines or anti-money laundering systems, are powered by graphs. The graph database operationalizes the data by making it possible for the app to traverse the data. Once you have this ability, the data becomes actionable.
